BTree Cormen | Intro to Algorithms

1. Every node x ...
    x.n = # of keys currently stored in node x
    x.k1 <= x.k2 <= x.k3 <= ... <= x.kn
    x.leaf a boolean value that is true if x is a leaf and false otherwise
2. Each internal node x
    x.n+1 pointers (its children)
        x.c1, x.c2, ..., x.cn, x.cn+1
3. The keys x.k1 separate the ranges of keys stored in each subtree:

    k1 <= x.k1 <= k2 <= x.k2 <= ... <= x.kn <= kn+1

    where ki is any key stored in the subtree with root x.ci
4. All leaves have the same depth
5. Nodes have lower and upper bounds on the number of keys they can contain.
    minimum degree of btree is t

    - Every node except root must have at least t-1 keys
        Every internal node other than the root must have at least t children
    - Every node may contain at most 2t-1 keys
        Every internal node may have at most 2t children

Due to every internal node then has either 2, 3, or 4 children, we call a B-tree of order t a 2-3-4 tree.
