hierarchical spatial tree data structure
based on the principle of recursive decomposition of space
    separators parallel to the coordinate axis
resulting split of a region into four regions corresponding to the 
    southwest, northwest, southeast, northeast

in a three dimensional (octree)
    a region is split into eight regions 
        using planes parallel to coordinate planes
    8-way split of the region associated with it

Analogous DS for representing spatial data in higher than tree dimensions
    are called hyperoctrees


The tree structure allows quick focusing on regions of interest
    which facilitates the design of fast algorithms.

Consider the problem of 'spherical region query'
    Find all points in a data set that lie withing a given distan from a query point

The unit aspect ratio employed in most quadtree data structures 
    allows geometric arguments useful in designing fast algorithms 
        for certain classes of applications

The different variants of the quadtree data structure are differentiated 
    by the principle used in the recursive decomposition process
