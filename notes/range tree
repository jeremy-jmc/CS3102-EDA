"b+tree de grado 1"

k-dimensional space R^k
supports general range queries of the form 
    [xl^1, xr^1] x [xl^2, xr^2] x ... x [xl^k, xr^k]
where
    xl^i <= xr^i
    xl^i, xr^i \in R
cartesian product of k ranges is referred to as a kD range
solves the range search problem
    find all the points ins S that satisfy any range query

augmented bst which easily generalize to higher dimensions

CONSTRUCTION
    root node v
    set S of points in k-dimensional space R^k
        S = {p_i = (x_i^1, x_i^2, ..., x_i^k) for i = 1, 2, ..., n}
            p_i.x^j = x_i^j     j-th coordinate value of point p_i
    v.key 
        is to partition S into two approximately equal subsets S_l and S_r
        respectively of the hyperplane H^k: x^k = v.key

        v.key = median of the kth coordinate values of all the points in S

    node v {
        node left_subtree       S_l
        node right_subtree      S_r
